# Project structure

This structure is only a recommendation. You can read about this structure here:

[Recommendations and best practices for implementing MVVM in XAML/.NEt applications](https://blog.rsuter.com/recommendations-best-practices-implementing-mvvm-xaml-net-applications/)

May you noticed the **Models** folder is missing. It is becuase we store our Models in the **SanityArchiver.Application** project instead.
